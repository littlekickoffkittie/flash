# User Workspace

## Project Overview

User Workspace is a project built with Hardhat, showcasing the capabilities of Solidity smart contracts and testing frameworks. It utilizes various libraries, tools, and networks for efficient development and testing of Ethereum-based applications.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash

   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.

## Usage

Once the project is set up, you can compile and test your smart contracts:

1. **Compile contracts**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. **Run tests**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. **Deploy contracts to the Sepolia network** (if configured in your `hardhat.config.js`):
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepoliaFork
   ```

## Features

- Compatibility with Solidity 0.8.20
